# Ipen - draft idea

Ipen is a **personal, basic alternative** to the Windows EpicPen application.
I created it to support my learning process since I like to annotate directly on my screen while studying. 

The only Linux alternative I found was [Gromit-MPX](https://github.com/bk138/gromit-mpx), but it caused several issues and, in some setups, didn’t work at all.
So, I decided to build my own tool to meet my basic needs.

## Features
- Annotate directly on your screen.
- Shortcuts and UI for color switching
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Clear screen
- Stroke based erasing

## Why I Built It
Ipen is the result of my desire to create something useful, even if it’s not perfect. While the code might not be flawless, this project represents my commitment to learning, building, and improving.

## Notes
- I acknowledge that this might not be written in the most suitable language, framework, or libraries for its use case.
- The code may be far from perfect, but it works for me, and that’s what matters.

I’ve decided that from this year onward, **delivering is more important than striving for perfection**.
While I’m unsure if I’ll continue developing Ipen in the near future, I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished and learned during these weeks.
